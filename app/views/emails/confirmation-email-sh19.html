      <p class="govuk-body">An examiner will process the uploaded document to check if it's acceptable for filing. Documents are registered with the date they are uploaded to Companies House as long as they are acceptable.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You uploaded the SH19 using the same day service. This means the document is processed on the same working day if we receive it by 11am, and you’ve also uploaded the relevant resolution and solvency statement by this time. If you uploaded the SH19 and relevant documents after 11am, we will process them the next working day.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We'll email you to tell you if the document is acceptable for filing. If the document is not acceptable, we'll email you to let you know what to do next.</p>
